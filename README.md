# DTI_CRUD_project
A test CRUD project written in .NET

The goal is to create an ap with following logic: 

In this puzzle, you are required to store and display a list of words and descriptions to build a
glossary of terms into a persistent data store. This puzzle should give you the opportunity to
demonstrate your flair for technology and your programming style.  The choice of technology
used to solve this puzzle is entirely at your discretion.
Glossary Term Model
Glossary
Term The term of reference
Definition A paragraph of text describing the meaning of the term.
Sample Glossary
Term Definition
abyssal plain The ocean floor offshore from the continental margin, usually very flat with a slight

slope.

accrete v. To add terranes (small land masses or pieces of crust) to another, usually larger,

land mass.

alkaline Term pertaining to a highly basic, as opposed to acidic, subtance. For example,

hydroxide or carbonate of sodium or potassium.

 Stories
 As a glossary author, I would like to add a term and definition to the system so I can
continually grow our knowledge base of terms.
 As a glossary author, I would like to edit a term so I can fix mistakes and update
definitions.
 As a glossary author, I would like to remove terms that I no longer feel are necessary or
valid.
 As a glossary author, I would like to view the alphabetically sorted list of terms and
definitions so I can find a particular term quickly.
Acceptance Criteria
 Should have full CRUD operations
 Should show terms sorted alphabetically
 Existing terms should be visible when the application starts
